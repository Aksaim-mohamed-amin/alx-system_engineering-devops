Welcome to the "0x06. Regular Expressions" project! In this project, you will delve into the world of regular expressions in programming. Regular expressions are powerful tools used for pattern matching and text processing, allowing you to search, extract, and manipulate strings with ease.

## Introduction

In this project, you will learn about:

-   **Regular Expressions**: Understanding what regular expressions are and how they are used to describe patterns in strings.
-   **Metacharacters**: Exploring metacharacters, which are special characters used in regular expressions to represent classes of characters or specify repetition.
-   **Pattern Matching**: Learning how to use regular expressions to search for patterns within strings and extract specific information.
-   **Text Processing**: Understanding how regular expressions can be applied to various text processing tasks, such as validation, extraction, and substitution.
